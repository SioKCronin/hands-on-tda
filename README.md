# Hands-on TDA (Topological Data Analysis)

## Overview

I'm interested in presenting a talk on Topological Data Analysis (TDA); particularly an overview of open source projects,
practical applications to explore, and a survey of the most immediate technical challenges facing incorporating TDA into
our work as data analysis projects and pipelines.  I've begun exploring how TDA can help in our work at Landed, and while 
it is too soon to  share our research, I'll anchor this exploration in the real estate and finance use cases we're exploring.
There are great topology resources online and a handful of useful lectures from Anthony Bak at Ayasdi on TDA, but a dearth
of resources covering open source tools, successful applications in industry (with open source tools), and practical
implications for engineers.  This talk will not dive too deep into the broader domain of topology, but will include a 
brief overview to get everyone on the same page, with lots of links to further reading/exploration.
